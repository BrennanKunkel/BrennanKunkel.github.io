    <p>The concept of onomatopoeia words can be difficult to understand without examples. Examples give you the chance to better understand the onomatopoeia concept and to see and sound out actual words.

This article lists five categories of onomatopoeic words with several examples of each. The list includes words with letter combinations that are commonly used to represent certain sounds. It isn’t an exhaustive list of onomatopoeic words, but it’s a good start to understand the onomatopoeia concept.
